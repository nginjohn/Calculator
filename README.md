# Calculator
Calculator is working properly that there is an uploading problem about finished working java folder. So i uploaded rar folder instead


First option: Unrar the calculator-palette.rar and import Eclipse IDE then run the  java code.

Second option to get bin, src,image folders in one folder then import in Eclipse IDE


Basic Calculator is working fine.
